| 06-15 | 3:00  | Working on initialization and rotation methods created makefile                                                                   |
| 06-16 | 3:00  | Wrote function to check if cube is solved, refactored code to use stuct to track movement                                         |
| 06-17 | 3:00  | Rewrote scramble, Started work on RUBIKS_SEQENTIAL, started work on how to find identical rotations                               |
| 06-19 | 6:00  | Rewrote scramble, Started rewriting cube implementation, It was a mess and broken, now it less of a mess and still broken         |
| 06-19 | 4:00  | Spent 4 hours chasing down a bug that was an outdated pair initialization and verification functions... rotate now passes test... |
| Total | 19:00 |                                                                                                                                   |


Edit this README file so that it contains the following:

-an indication of how much time you spent on the project (you should keep track of this as you go)
-a description of what the project does
-an explanation of how to compile and run the program (and what machine to run it on).  
If your instructor doesn't have access to the machine then you should put screenshots of runs of
your code in the respository.
-a list of what was completed
-a list of what didn't get completed because of bugs in the code
-a list of what didn't get completed due to lack of time (ideas for future work)
-a link to the presentation that you gave to the class (or put the actual presentation in the repository)
